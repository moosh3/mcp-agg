# MCP-Agg Project Plan

## Project Overview

The MCP-Agg project aims to provide a remote, centralized location for LLM applications to access external context, tools, and prompts. It contains a number of apps, which represent external services (e.g. Slack, GitHub, etc.). For each app, there exist a number of tools that can be executed, and a number of resources that can be accessed. 

An app is defined as a third-party system for which there exist a number of MCP tools that can be used to interact with the system. There are no priority apps for integration - the system is designed to allow registration of any app, with Slack and GitHub being examples of commonly used services.

Using authentication, users are able to generate a unique URL that can be ingested via an MCP client to access the apps and associated tools that are available to them.

The user uses the App API to register apps, providing authentication credentials for each app. The MCP-Agg server then uses these credentials to authenticate with the app and access its tools and resources.

## Background

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol is a client-server architecture that enables LLM applications to access external context, tools, and prompts. Key components include:

- **Hosts**: LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
- **Clients**: Components that maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
- **Servers**: Services that provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

MCP helps build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs by providing:
- Pre-built integrations that LLMs can directly access
- Flexibility to switch between LLM providers
- Security best practices for handling data

## Project Goals

1. Create a FastAPI Python application that exposes a REST API for managing apps and their associated tools and resources
2. For each app, implement a MCP server that exposes tools, resources, and prompts 
3. Allow LLM applications to discover and execute tools through natural language
4. Provide a secure authentication flow for connecting to apps
5. Implement proper error handling and feedback mechanisms
6. Create a frontend that allows users to register apps and app connections
7. Develop a system that generates a user-specific MCP server URL for client configuration
